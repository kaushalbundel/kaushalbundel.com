## I found this excellent product breakdown of Calm(Meditation App),[How Calm uses premium to motivate](https://kristenberman.substack.com/p/how-calm-uses-premium-to-motivate). This article delves on the following key points: {#i-found-this-excellent-product-breakdown-of-calm--meditation-app--how-calm-uses-premium-to-motivate-dot-this-article-delves-on-the-following-key-points}

Meditation is often perceived as a challenging pursuit. The behavioral and mental shifts following regular meditation practice vary from person to person and typically emerge after a sustained period. Moreover, tailoring the environment to enhance each individual's experience is not always possible. Consider the scenario where you've resolved to meditate, aiming to silence the cacophony of thoughts. You download an app and subscribe. Despite setting this intention and taking action, the likelihood of experiencing a transformative, day-altering meditation session is relatively slim. Contrast this with joining a gym. Discontent with your health and ongoing physical issues, you muster the courage to sign up for a premium gym membership. Surrounded by individuals showcasing their physical achievements, you're motivated by the possibility of similar success. Your first session, amidst gleaming equipment, ignites a thrill and a satisfying sensation in your biceps, affirming your decision.

The challenge then is, how can we ensure users return, especially when their initial experience might fall short of expectations?

-   One approach may be targeting individuals with high motivation and intent.

How do we identify a highly motivated individual?

-   A willingness to commit financially to a subscription for a set period may indicate high motivation.

How does this strategy differ from typical product on-boarding?

-   Common on-boarding strategies focus heavily on user experience, often offering free trials or premium features. This approach, however, may not be as effective for such a product.

After the initial onboarding, assuming a decent experience, one might wonder how to maintain the motivation for daily meditation, especially when tangible results appear distant.

Meditation, being a solitary activity, can be challenging if one struggles with self-acceptance. This contrasts with the gym environment, where external stimuli—such as observing others, the allure of new equipment, and the presence of potential romantic interests—can boost motivation.

So, how can one sustain a long-term meditation practice?

-   The solution isn't straightforward, given meditation's introspective nature and the app's focus on external stimuli. Strategies to encourage regular practice might include fostering a supportive community and setting a consistent meditation schedule. Timing notifications to remind users or adjusting schedules based on user feedback can also play a crucial role.
