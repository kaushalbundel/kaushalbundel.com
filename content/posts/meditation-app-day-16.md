## <span class="org-todo todo WAITING">WAITING</span> Another exiting tutorial by "[The Digital Pro's NoCode Academy](https://www.youtube.com/@the_digitalpro)" on  "[building beautiful charts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr5xHfk1nQY&ab_channel=TheDigitalPro%27sNoCodeAcademy)" in Flutterflow. {#another-exiting-tutorial-by-the-digital-pro-s-nocode-academy-on-building-beautiful-charts-in-flutterflow-dot}

-   State "WAITING"    from "IN-PROGRESS" <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2024-03-20 Wed 23:31] </span></span> <br />
    I should complete basic Dart and flutter course before jumping on this task.
-   State "IN-PROGRESS" from "TODO"       <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2024-03-20 Wed 18:12]</span></span>

Note: This has a special utility for me as with this I could create the date wise charts for "Meditation completion" and "Mood Board Completion" tracking.

-   The tutorial involved lots of custom code. The custom code is nothing but Dart code. I will learn to code in Dart and then I will come back and update this task.

-   In order to ensure accountability, I will share my takeaways from the learning Dart programming and flutter framework in my future blog posts.
