# Prompt Engineering as an Iterative process

There is not single effective method for getting the desired results from the a LLM. For general tasks the process of getting response to a desired problem is simple, whereas for specific problems one needs to used iterative methods to arrive at desired results.

In addition sometime we just do not know what the final result will look like, in such situations moulding the LLM response is essential.

## Task: Write a set of tweets for a car launch

These tweets look markedly better than the first set of tweets that the model returned and this shows that through this iterative process we can improve the way to get desired results.
