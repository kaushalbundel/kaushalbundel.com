## Product Related Thoughts {#product-related-thoughts}

Day before Yesterday, I had a fascinating discussion with a UI/UX specialist that delved into the core essence of our product and overall design philosophy. The conversation naturally drifted towards the uniqueness of our meditation app, its necessity, and the critical aspect of user engagement. This got me rethinking about the core nature of the app.

**About need for this meditation app**

The fundamental concept behind our product resonates with me. Even though I haven't personally experienced it yet, I believe it holds significant benefits for its users. Perhaps I should dive in and immerse myself in its features to truly grasp its value and impact on my own well-being.

**How is this product different from other meditation apps**

When I thought of this product, I was aiming to solve the following problems:

-   Our fast-paced modern lifestyles and stressful environments demand moments of respite.

-   Individuals often lack the time for traditional meditative practices or journaling.

-   True wisdom often emerges from our inner reflections rather than external sources.

-   A constant reminder of our internal dialogue can help in self-awareness and personal growth.

The product (I think) solves the above problems in the following manner:

-   The product in its initial form focuses on a combination of meditation, mood tracking and writing a tool to understand yourself and the environment around you. The three features work hand in hand:
    -   Mood Tracking: This feature tracks, assess and helps to understand what is impacting mood day after day. A free text field is an important element of the whole process where one can write down the causes of the bad mood or offer gratitude for a good day. It forces you to think about and nudges you to find a solution to your transitory troubles.

    -   Meditation: This feature helps you to calm down when you are overwhelmed. It allows you a small window of moment to focus on yourself. The writing prompt immediately after the meditation allows to jot down the thoughts that are running in your head.

    -   Importance of Writing: Once the system will have enough information that is written in your own words, it will prompt you to your previous days of happiness and gratitude so that you can explore and find out what worked for you on those days.

The app will also feature:

-   A sleek, user-friendly interface.

-   Affordable pricing compared to similar tools in app stores.

**Is the product sticky enough to make users come back repeatedly**

Is this what I want in a meditation app?

-   The users in the above question refers to the thrones of people that download a mass product like facebook or in similar context mass products like Insight Timer, Headspace or Calm. They all are excellent tools that provide everything for everyone. I have used a couple of them and have reaped the benefit of their time tested and excellent features.

    I do not think I compete with them though. What I am creating is a tool for me and people like me. This is a highly opinionated tool, it expects you to work in a certain way to realize its true advantages.

Don't I want more users?

-   At some level I think the answer is, yes. But I know in my heart that when I started the aim was to create an impact in a sustainable manner and not to create profit. I think I am going to listen to my heart and do that thing that really satisfies it.
