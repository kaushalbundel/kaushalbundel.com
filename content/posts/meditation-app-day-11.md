We are at the last leg of the development effort for Phase 0. This is a time filled with both fear and excitement. The stakes are high and the possibility of mistakes is significant, yet the opportunity for learning is abundant. In terms of developmental efforts,

-   Core functionalities are defined and implemented

-   Major UX work is complete. The app flow is more or less defined. For whom the app is, What the app will do and how it will work is also defined

-   Core Backend work is complete. All the pre-defined database tables and relationships are complete and I do not foresee and changes in that

** Note: This is a primary scope and is bound to be updated as more information is reviewed **

A quote to remember from [Ernest Shackleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Shackleton):

> “Just when things looked their worse, they changed for the best. I have marveled often at the thin line that divides success from failure and the sudden turn that leads from apparently certain disaster to comparative safety.”
